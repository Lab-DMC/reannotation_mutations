# reannotation_mutations
The code here shared was used for the detection of significant clusters of point mutations based on four different methods, as described in the paper: "Reannotation of cancer mutations based on expressed RNA transcripts reveals novel functional non-coding mutations in melanoma", link: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0002929725001466.
The main.R file contains the running code for three of the clustering methods, developed at the LDMC by Daniele Pepe. 
The output will be an excel file with the results for skin cancer melanoma described in the paper. The R functions are also shared to make the analysis reproducible. 

To run the code:
1) download all the files provided;
2) open the main.R file in R and run the code.
